### Location:

- Avoids edges to prevent camping

## Visual Effects

## Power-Up Interactions

- Timer resets

### With Reflection:
‚úÖ Reflected projectiles **keep** power-up effects!
- Reflected 2x damage fireball still deals 2x damage
- Reflected giant projectile stays giant

### With Ice Shard:
‚úÖ Power-ups work on ALL spell types
- Ice shards can be giant, fast, or deal more damage

### With Lightning:
‚ö†Ô∏è Lightning is instant (no projectile)
- Speed/Giant power-ups don't affect lightning
- Damage boost **DOES** affect lightning (50 damage!)
- Rapid fire **DOES** affect lightning cooldown
