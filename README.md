## Tips & Strategy

1. **Manage Your Mana** - Don't spam spells; wait for mana to regenerate
2. **Shield Timing** - Block high-damage lightning bolts to gain mana advantage
3. **Dash for Dodging** - Use dash invincibility to dodge through projectiles
4. **Maintain Distance** - Lightning requires line of sight; use movement to avoid
5. **Combo Attacks** - Follow up a shield break with quick fireball
6. **Bait Shields** - Force opponent to waste their shield cooldown

## Known Issues
