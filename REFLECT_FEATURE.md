# Reflect Attack Feature - Documentation

## Overview
Shields now **reflect projectiles** back at the attacker instead of just blocking them!

## How It Works

### When You Block a Projectile:
1. **Shield flashes white** - Visual confirmation of successful block
2. **Mana restored** - You get +10 mana as before
3. **Projectile bounces back** - The spell reverses direction toward the attacker!
4. **Reflected projectile is faster** - 1.5x original speed
5. **Color changes** - Visual indicator that it's reflected:
   - **Fireball**: Changes to purple/pink
   - **Ice Shard**: Changes to bright cyan

### Reflection Mechanics

**Ownership Changes:**
- The reflected projectile now "belongs" to the blocker
- It can damage the original caster
- The original caster's shield can reflect it back again!

**Speed Boost:**
- Reflected projectiles travel 50% faster
- Makes them harder to dodge
- Rewards good timing on blocks

**Visual Feedback:**
- Shield pulses and flashes white on successful reflection
- Projectile changes color (purple fireballs, cyan ice shards)
- Projectile briefly enlarges during reflection

## Strategy Tips

### Offensive:
- **Bait shields**: Force your opponent to waste their shield, then attack
- **Spam attacks**: Overwhelm shields before cooldown refreshes
- **Use lightning**: Can't be reflected (it's instant hitscan)

### Defensive:
- **Time your shields perfectly**: Reflect high-damage spells back
- **Reflect volleys**: Create a fireball tennis match!
- **Mana advantage**: Each reflection gives you +10 mana
- **Counter-attack**: Use reflected projectiles to pressure while you cast your own

### Advanced Tactics:
- **Reflection Chain**: Player 1 shoots ‚Üí Player 2 reflects ‚Üí Player 1 reflects back ‚Üí etc.
- **Shield Baiting**: Activate shield to make opponent hesitate, then attack when they hold fire
- **Mana Drain**: Reflect enemy projectiles to gain mana while they lose it

## Controls Reminder

### Player 1 (Red Wizard):
- **Shield**: Press **R**
- **Fireball**: Press **Q**

### Player 2 (Blue Wizard):
- **Shield**: Press **P**
- **Fireball**: Press **I**

## Visual Indicators

### Normal Projectiles:
- **Fireball**: Orange/red with yellow core
- **Ice Shard**: Blue crystalline

### Reflected Projectiles:
- **Fireball**: Purple/pink with yellow core
- **Ice Shard**: Bright cyan with white highlights

### Shield States:
- **Active**: Semi-transparent colored barrier
- **Blocking**: White flash, bright border
- **Cooldown**: Invisible (3 second cooldown)

## Balance Changes

**Shield is now more powerful because:**
- ‚úÖ Blocks damage
- ‚úÖ Restores 10 mana
- ‚úÖ Reflects projectile back
- ‚úÖ Reflected projectile is 50% faster

**But still balanced by:**
- ‚ùå 15 mana cost to activate
- ‚ùå 3 second cooldown
- ‚ùå Only lasts 1.5 seconds
- ‚ùå Can't block lightning (hitscan)
- ‚ùå Requires good timing

## Known Interactions

### What Can Be Reflected:
‚úÖ Fireballs
‚úÖ Ice Shards
‚úÖ Already-reflected projectiles (chain reflections!)

### What Cannot Be Reflected:
‚ùå Lightning bolts (instant beam, no projectile)
‚ùå Dash attacks (no damage)

## Fun Scenarios

### Fireball Tennis:
Two skilled players can volley a fireball back and forth multiple times, each reflection getting faster!

### Mana Battery:
Block enemy projectiles to gain mana, use mana to cast your own spells, creating a resource advantage.

### Reverse Uno Card:
Bait an expensive lightning bolt, shield it for mana, then counter with your own reflected fireball plus a fresh spell!
